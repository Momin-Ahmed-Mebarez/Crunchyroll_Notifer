# Crunchyroll_Notifer
A python script to display notifications on your screen whenever Crunchyroll drops a new episode






Limitations:
-Since I am not using windows 10 I couldn't use win10toast which is a better library for handling notifications 

-I didn't implement any error handling so the program may terminate silently if the website is down for example.



Important:
-Use pip install -r requirements.txt the first time you use the program

-Use pythonw.exe Crunchyroll_Notifer to run the program as a background task. The only way to close the script after that is using task manager (although it barely uses memory but some can find it annoying )

-Although it shouldn't but I am not sure if this script will trigger anti-cheats so use at your own risk
